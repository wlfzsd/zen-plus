# Changelog

## v0.25.1-plus.1

### 中文

基于上游 v0.25.1 的 zen-plus 首个发布：过滤规则引擎两轮深度优化，**拦截行为与上游完全一致**。

### 改进
- 引擎匹配耗时 **-60.7%**（370.3µs → 145.7µs/请求，真实订阅 61.1 万规则语料）
- 每请求堆分配 **-93.4%**（1175 次/132KB → 225 次/8.7KB）
- 引擎 live 内存 **-21.5%**（494 → 388 B/规则）

### 手段
正则形状特化、最稀 token 反向索引（Ghostery 技巧）、请求级缓存、规则/树节点结构瘦身、池化低分配遍历。详见 [docs/benchmarks](https://github.com/wlfzsd/zen-plus/tree/upstream-chain/docs/benchmarks)。

### 安装
下载 Zen.exe 覆盖 `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Zen\Zen.exe`（配置与过滤器缓存通用）。SHA256 见下方 Assets。

### English

First zen-plus release on top of upstream v0.25.1: two rounds of deep filter-engine optimization with **blocking behavior identical to upstream**.

### Improvements
- Engine matching time **-60.7%** (370.3µs → 145.7µs/request, 611k-rule real-subscription corpus)
- Per-request heap allocations **-93.4%** (1,175/132KB → 225/8.7KB)
- Engine live memory **-21.5%** (494 → 388 B/rule)

### Means
Regexp shape specialization, rarest-token reverse index (Ghostery technique), per-request caches, slimmed rule/node layouts, pooled low-alloc traversal. See [docs/benchmarks](https://github.com/wlfzsd/zen-plus/tree/upstream-chain/docs/benchmarks).

## v0.25.0

### What's New

* **Xin chào!**
  Zen's UI is now available in Vietnamese. Thanks to @vuanhvu11982!
* **Fixed proxy start for non-admin macOS accounts**
  Pressing "Start" failed on standard (non-admin) macOS accounts with a "Command requires admin privileges" error, because `networksetup` refused to run without elevation. Zen now elevates these commands when needed, so starting the proxy prompts for admin approval instead of failing. Thanks to @stevehartwell for reporting the issue!
* **Linux installation script**
  A new `install.sh` script installs and uninstalls Zen across Linux distributions, automating the manual process of downloading and extracting a portable binary. See the README for usage. Thanks to @ohdonny!
* **Fixed Linux autostart**
  Zen was writing its autostart entry to `~/.config` instead of `~/.config/autostart`, so "Start on login" had no effect. The entry is now created in the correct directory, with a migration that fixes existing installs on upgrade. Thanks to @yofukashino!
* **More reliable filter list updates**
  Filter list fetching now survives slow or unreliable connections. Downloads are retried with backoff, updates are requested conditionally to save bandwidth, and Zen falls back to the last known-good list instead of losing protection when a fetch fails outright.
* **Friendly error page on failed page loads**
  Browser navigations that fail at the proxy now show a readable error page instead of a broken connection.
* **Proxy performance improvements**
  Long-lived connections (SSE, long polling) are no longer cut off by a fixed request timeout, idle connection limits were raised, and outbound connections now close cleanly on shutdown.
* **Other improvements**
  Faster process lookups on Linux via kernel Netlink queries instead of `/proc` parsing (thanks @LucasM4r!), and the Rules help button now points to Zen's new documentation site.

## v0.24.1

### What's New

* **Scriptlet fixes**
  Fixed a couple of bugs that stopped some scriptlet rules from working, which could let ads and trackers through on certain sites. The affected rules now behave as written.

Thank you for using Zen!

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/irbis-sh/zen-desktop/compare/v0.24.0...v0.24.1

## v0.24.0

### What's New
* **Linux app starts again without `libayatana-appindicator3`**
  Since `v0.23.0`, Zen failed to launch on Linux systems that didn't have AppIndicator installed, quitting with a shared-library loading error. Zen now loads the system tray library at runtime instead of linking it at build time, so the app starts whether or not the library is present. If you ran into this after updating, see the troubleshooting guide: https://docs.irbis.sh/docs/zen/how-to/troubleshoot/#zen-wont-start-after-updating-to-v0230
* **`important` modifier**
  Zen now supports the `important` rule modifier. An important rule wins over regular exception rules, and only an important exception rule can cancel it. Thanks to @LucasM4r!
* **`ping` content-type modifier**
  Rules can now match hyperlink auditing (ping) requests with the `ping` content-type modifier. Thanks to @LucasM4r!
* **Noop modifiers**
  Zen now accepts noop modifiers (`_`) in rules and ignores them during parsing, which improves compatibility with filter lists. Thanks to @kamalovk!

## v0.23.0

### What's New

* **Linux system tray support**
  Zen now sits in the system tray on Linux in supported desktop environments. Closing the window minimizes Zen to the tray and keeps the proxy running instead of shutting it down. Thanks to @ohdonny!
* **こんにちは！**
  Zen's UI is now available in Japanese, thanks to @AI-Avalon!
* **WebSocket filtering**
  WebSocket traffic can now be matched and blocked. Additionally, Zen now recognizes the `$websocket` content type modifier. Thanks to @inflame-ue!
* **More reliable content-type matching**
  Content-type rules now match against the `Content-Type` response header, not only the `Sec-Fetch-Dest` request header. These rules now work more consistently, especially with non-browser apps. Thanks to @Mirwinli!
* **Separate PAC port setting**
  Settings > Advanced now has a field for the PAC proxy port. Useful for apps that do not respect system proxy settings automatically and need to be configured to use Zen manually.
* **Other improvements**
  Tightened the scope of generated certificates (thanks @inflame-ue!), fixed a resource leak when the proxy fails to start (thanks @Mirwinli!), improved filtering accuracy (thanks @Mirwinli!), and made other internal improvements to the filtering engine.

## v0.22.0

### What's New

* **Regular-expression rule support**
  Zen now supports regexp rules. This improves compatibility with filter lists that use regexp patterns to match dynamic tracking and ad URLs.
* **Fixed allowlisting for hosts rules**
  The "Allow" button on "Blocked by Zen" pages now works correctly when the block was caused by a hosts-style rule such as `0.0.0.0 example.net`.
* **Fixed macOS service compatibility**
  HTTPS exclusions were updated to fix sign-in and calling issues with Apple Messages and FaceTime. Thanks to @rishiskhare for reporting the issue!
* **Removed a stale built-in filter lists**
  An outdated Polish anti-adblock list has been removed from the configuration. Thanks to @qorexdevs for the contribution!
* **UI polish**
  The header and filter lists now use cleaner divider styling for a more consistent look.
